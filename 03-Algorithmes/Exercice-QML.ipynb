    "# Exercice 03 — Quantum machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Exercice taken from qhack_2023_coding_challenges</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum machine learning is an area of research that explores the interplay between quantum computing and machine learning. Quantum machine learning models might offer significant speedups for performing certain tasks like classification, image processing, and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you'll learn the meat and potatoes of training a quantum machine learning model. Specifically, you will implement a procedure for embedding classical numbers into a quantum computer, construct a simple quantum machine learning model, and perform three optimization steps. The quantum circuit in the model that you will implement looks like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " In the code below, you must complete the following functions:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `three_optimization_steps`: performs three optimization steps.\n",
    " - `cost`: this is within the `three_optimization_steps` function. `cost` is a QNode that does a few things:\n",
    "   + acts on 3 qubits only;\n",
    "   + embeds the input `data` via **amplitude embedding**;\n",
    "   + defines a basic entangling layer with rotation on the X axis (below is an example of a basic entangling layer); and\n",
    "   + returns the expectation value of $\\sum_{i = 1}^n Z_i$, where $n$ is the number of qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " **Basic entangling layer**\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"./images/basic_entangler.png\" width=\"650\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    " A basic entangling layer consist of rotation gates followed by CNOT gates that entangle the qubits together.\n",
    " \n",
    " To perform three optimization steps, use a gradient decent optimizer with a step size of $0.01$. `weights` are the parameters that will be optimized.\n",
    " \n",
    " Here are some helpful **PennyLane** resources:\n",
    " \n",
    " - [Optimizing a quantum circuit — YouTube video](https://youtu.be/TiQ7T1h8VAQ)\n",
    " - [Basic tutorial: qubit rotation — Optimization](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation.html#optimization)\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Input \n",
    " \n",
    " As input to this problem, you are given classical `data` (`list(float)`) that you must embed into a quantum circuit via **amplitude embedding**\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " This code must output the evaluation of `cost` after three optimization steps have been performed.\n",
    " \n",
    " If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's a `1e-4` relative error tolerance), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
    " \n",
    " Good luck!\n",
    " ### Imports\n",
    " The cell below specifies the libraries you should use in this challenge. Run the cell to import the libraries."
