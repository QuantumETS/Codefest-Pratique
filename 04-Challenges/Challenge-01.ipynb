    "# Challenge 01 - Mid-Circuit Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Challenge taken from qhack_2023_coding_challenges</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical computations, inserting control flow — e.g, if statements — right in the middle of a large computation is no problem at all since measuring variables does not affect the output of the computation. The same can't be said about quantum computations — if we measure, we better be careful!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you'll look at how mid-circuit measurements work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " In the code below, you are given a function called `circuit`. **You must complete this function** by constructing the following four-qubit circuit:\n",
    " \n",
    " <p align=\"center\">\n",
    " <img src=\"./images/daily8.png\" width=\"650\"/>\n",
    " </p>\n",
    " \n",
    " The circuit has a Hadamard gate on every qubit, an $R_x$ gate, a couple of CNOTs, and then the mid-circuit measurements. Note here that the measurements happen on the first and third qubits, and that the [`U3`] gate is only applied to the fourth qubit if the following condition is met upon measuring the first and third wires: $m_0 + m_2 \\geq 1$ (i.e. at least one of them is $1$). The last operator, `PauliZ` on the fourth qubit, is applied regardless.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Input \n",
    " \n",
    " As input to this problem, you are given:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `angles` (`list(float)`): a list of angles containing $\\theta_0$, $\\theta_1$, $\\theta_2$, and $\\theta_3$ in that order. Use this to create the circuit!\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " This code must output a `numpy.tensor` containing  the probabilities associated to a computational basis measurement **on the fourth qubit.**\n",
    " \n",
    " If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's a `1e-4` relative error tolerance), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
    " \n",
    " Good luck!\n",
    " ### Imports\n",
    " The cell below specifies the libraries you should use in this challenge. Run the cell to import the libraries."
